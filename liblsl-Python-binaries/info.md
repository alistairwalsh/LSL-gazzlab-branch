These are compiled binaries for the labstreaminglayer with python bindings, the .so files should be placed in the /binaries-python2.7/ folder 
then can be imported with the pylsl script in the liblsl-Python directory

Alternatively, since the other "binaries" folder are pointless one can just copy the .so file and the liblsl.py script from the binaries folder
and modify pylsl.py to just import that rather than running the version check.
